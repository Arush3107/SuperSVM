# SuperSVM
This Project has different functions which are used at various satges in the algorithm.
Proxg function is used to calculate the proximal of 1-norm.
OperatorT and OperatorTi is used to calculate T value.
adjOperatorT and adjOperatorTi is used to calculate T* value.
feature_transformation is used to transform or scale the input training data and can be updated to any non-linear transformations as well.
rfactor is used to calculate the hinge loss.
Projection is used to calculate the Projection of the vector.
svm_training is used to formulate the calssification model from training data.
dis is used to predict the class of the test data.
